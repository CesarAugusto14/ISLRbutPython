# ISLRbutPython
This is for my practices using the book ISLR, from Gareth James. 

You can find the book and the datasets from http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/

I suggest to install the Anaconda distribution on your computer, since you will have every single module and library I used during the development of these notebooks. I also suggest to install Nbextensions for your Jupyter Notebook, since I used several of them (for example, the LaTeX support). I hope it is useful for everyone looking for help in this area. 

Note that these notebooks are work in progress. I will be updating them and uploading them while I'm working on them.
